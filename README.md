What is SmartPark about?
__________________________
SmartPark is a showcase of what a Smart Carpark can look like. It has a few features such as recommending an empty parking lot to a user that is the nearest to a lobby (for malls). It also has LED lights to indicate if the lot is taken or not, which allows users to see from afar if that section of the carpark is taken so that he/she does not have to drive there and try to find the lots. Users can also visit the web interface that is accessible by both computer or mobile to check which lot they park their car in, in the event that they have forgotten. Apart from that, parking history can also be viewed online to see which carpark did they access previously and details such as time and pricing will also be there. Other features which normal carparks also have are free first 10 minutes parking, which will be scaled down to 15 seconds for demonstration purposes.

How the final set-up looks like
